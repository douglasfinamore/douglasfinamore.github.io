                <p>What you see here is meant to be a showcase of my work and career so far. Nothing fancy—just a place to put everything in one spot. I'm grateful to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ubnl9qwAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cristhiano Duarte</a> for the great talks he gave at Unicamp in winter 2025 on scientific communication and for all the inspiring material he sent me afterward in our email conversations.</p>

                <p>
                    This is a simple HTML webpage I built using my (extremely lacking) HTML/JavaScript skills and some help from GPT models. It wasn't designed with mobile phones in mind—because I'm old. That said, I did try to make it look decent on smaller screens (though, given my lacking skills, no promises).
                    It took me about a week of late-night work and roughly three liters of coffee to complete it. Yes, I don’t sleep well. Yes, I'm aware my evening beverage choices are to blame.
                </p>

                <p>Since I’m colourblind, I picked a palette from <a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Hunt</a> to make sure I didn’t end up with any, let’s say, <em>adventurous</em> colour choices. As for font pairings, I used a preset from <a href="https://fontjoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fontjoy</a> because, honestly, I don’t trust my own taste.</p>

                <p>Any good design choices? That’s all my wife. The bad ones? That’s on me.</p>

                <p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Pages</a> for free, and I don’t collect cookies, track your data, or spy on you in any way. So, if you're here to check out my work, feel free to explore and stay as long as you like. If you want to reach out, you can find my contact info somewhere around here.</p>

                <p>The sidebar has an "All rights reserved" note because I see this on every page I visit, so I thought I ought to have one on mine as well. But I haven’t actually registered anything. If you think this looks cool and want to copy it, go ahead. Hell, email me, and I’ll personally send you the HTML files.</p>

                <br />

                <p>No animals—other than myself—were harmed in the making of this.</p>
