                <p>
                    I am a postdoctoral researcher at IMECC - UNICAMP, trying to make sense of spaces of probabilities, their underlying geometry, and what all that has to do with dynamical systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I earned my Ph.D. from the Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (ICMC) at the University of São Paulo (USP) under the mentorship of Dr. Carlos Maquera.
                    We worked on a novel class of geometric structures known as \(q\)<i>-contact structures</i>, specifically exploring the actions and foliations they induce on their ambient manifolds.
                    Our work was recognized with an honorable mention at the 2024 CAPES award for best mathematics thesis in Brazil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2024, I held a postdoctoral position at CMLS, École Polytechnique, where I worked on spectral rigidity problems for Sinai billiards as part of the LESET/MathAmSud thematic project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The common thread among these seemingly distinct subjects, and the overall focus of my research efforts, is the interplay between dynamics and geometry.
                    I am particularly interested in contact dynamics (specifically, contact actions of higher-rank Lie groups), hyperbolic billiards, and the metric properties of probability spaces—most notably, methods for extracting dynamical information using the Wasserstein distance.
                    As a rule of thumb, I am quite intrigued by rigidity problems of all sorts.
                    If any of these topics resonate with you, feel free to contact me —I would be happy to discuss them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of mathematics, you might find me playing video games, cycling, obsessing over the minutiae of the sci-fi genre, or getting depressed by reading the news in the mornings.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;">
                    P.S.: As for the rumors about me being married to the most fantastic woman alive—yes, they're all very true. I can confirm it.
                </p>
